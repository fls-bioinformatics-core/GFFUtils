GFFUtils: utilities for handling GFF and GTF files
==================================================

Overview
********

The ``GFFUtils`` package provides a small set of utility programs
for working with GFF and GTF files, specifically:

 * ``GFFcleaner``: perform "cleaning" operations on a GFF file
 * ``GFF3_Annotation_Extractor``: combine and annotate feature
   counts (e.g. from ``htseq-count``) with data from a GFF file
 * ``GTF_extract``: extract selected data items from a GTF file
 * ``gtf2bed``: convert GTF file to BED format

Installation
************

To install from github, do::

    pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fls-bioinformatics-core/GFFUtils/master/requirements.txt
    pip install git+https://github.com/fls-bioinformatics-core/GFFUtils.git

.. note::

   ``GFFUtils`` is currently supported for the following Python
   versions:
